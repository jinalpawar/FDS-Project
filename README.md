Satellite Image Classification is a project developed by Jinal Pawar, Nhi Nguyen & Pietro Francesco for Fundamentals and Foundations of Data Science 2025/26 at La Sapienza University.
The project aims to compare the performance of 4 deep learning models: CNN, Fine-tuned ResNet18, ViT and Fine-tuned ViT_Base_Patch_16.
The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification/data

Final Results indicate CNN is more suitable for this task than ViT due to a smaller dataset size. Furthermore, Fine-tuned ResNet18 performs the best out of the 4. 
A live demonstration can be set up using streamlit app file present in the repo.
